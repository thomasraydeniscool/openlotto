    <h1>About OpenLotto</h1>
    <p>OpenLotto is a lottery that you will <strong>actually</strong> win. In a standard lottery on average you have your odds of winning are<br><strong>1 in 4,000,000,000</strong>. With OpenLotto you can get up to a <strong>11%</strong> chance of winning.</p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>A new draw is created every hour, each draw starts at zero.
      Then players are given the opportunity to bet on the draw for a chance to win the whole pot.</p>
    <p>When a player makes a bet the tokens staked are added the the price pot. The more players, the more winnings.</p>
    <h3>Why would I make a bet if the draw is at zero?</h3>
    <p>A single standard bet has a 1% chance of winning. When a draw starts there is a bonus to early players up to 10% on top of the standard bet.</p>
    <p>You need to be quick though because the bonus is reduced by 1% for each subsequent bet. This means that by the 11th bet the bonus will be gone.</p>
    <h4>If each user gets 1% for each bet, when there are more than 100 bets isn't it mathmaticly impossible.</h4>
    <p>When the sum of all the draw's bets probabilities reaches 100%, on the event of another bet, all the bets probabilities are reduced evenly to make space for more bets. If you received a bonus your weighting will always stay the same <strong>proportionally</strong>.</p>
